// Design an API with 3 endpoints:
each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside the Controller folder
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
// Peer Reviewed by : Elizabeth Trotter
// Peer Comment : Your code functions well when tested. I have a couple of suggestions: you can return a string rather than a list for two of your functions where you only return a single sentence, and the HttpPost should be a HttpGet since we are not adding any saved data (Jacob told me this earlier today for my assignment). Also, there is a small typo on line 11 of you ThirdService.cs file (greater than is in both sentences). Nice work!
